        Data Definition Language (DDL) is the part of SQL used to define and modify the structure of a database. Think of DDL as the blueprint for your database, outlining how data is organized into tables and other elements. DDL is important because it sets up the framework where your data will live, ensuring everything is properly structured before you insert any data. Common DDL commands include CREATE (to create new tables or databases) and DROP (to delete existing ones)
        By learning DDL, beginners can understand how to design the backbone of a database before working with the data itself.
